This project was conceived from the One-Hit Wonder - Tubthumping from Chumbawamba. After a lyrics analysis we decided to do a WebApp as a drinking game.

This project aims to provide great moments between friends or for total strangers to get to know each other.

It's not just another drinking game, it compiles many classical drinking games in just one.

As we said, this was a project done within 24h, so we lack many features but the game is completed and able to play.
